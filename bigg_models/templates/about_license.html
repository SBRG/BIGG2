  <h4 class="modal-title">About BiGG Models</h4>
</div>

<div class="modal-body">

  <p>BiGG Models is a knowledgebase of genome-scale metabolic network
  reconstructions.</p>

	<p>BiGG Models integrates more than 70 published genome-scale metabolic
	  networks into a single database with a set of stardized identifiers called
	  BiGG IDs. Genes in the BiGG models are mapped to NCBI genome annotations,
	  and metabolites are linked to many external databases (KEGG, PubChem, and
	  many more). For details about updates to the BiGG Models website and
    database, see the <a href="/updates">updates page</a> and the
    <a href="https://github.com/SBRG/bigg_models/releases">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

	<p>BiGG is freely available for non-commercial use. It is hosted and
	  maintained by the <a href="http://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/">Systems Biology
	  Research Group</a> at the <a href="http://ucsd.edu"> University of California, San Diego</a>.</p>

  <p>BiGG Models has replaced the original BiGG Database. If you are looking for
    the old BiGG, you can still find it here: </p>

  <p>If you have questions or find any bugs in the database, please sumbit an
    issue to our <a href="https://github.com/SBRG/bigg_models/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>
    or contact Zachary King (zaking-AT-ucsd-DOT-edu).</p>

  <h4 class="modal-title">How do I use BiGG Models?</h4>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">
  <p>BiGG can be browsed on this website or accessed using a <a href="/data_access">web
    API</a>. Try searching for a metabolite, reaction, gene, or organism in the
    search box to browse the content of genome-scale models. Question marks like
    this {% include 'question_mark.html' %} are available throughout the site to
    provide more help. Further information is available in the
    <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1049">BiGG Models publication</a>.

    <h4 class="modal-title">How do I add my model to BiGG?</h4>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">
    <p>We encourage contributions of models to BiGG. The following are the minimal
        requirements for acceptance into the knowledge base:

        <ul>
            <li>A genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction that has been
                published in a peer-reviewed journal</li>
            <li>A COBRApy-compatible file (SBML, MAT, or JSON) representing all
            model content, ideally included as a supplementary file to the
                original publication</li>
            <li>The accession ID for a NCBI RefSeq genome annotation. In some
                cases we can accept genome annotations in Genbank format, but we
                prefer annotations from a well-known genome repository.</li>
            <li>Reactions, metabolites, and compartments using the BiGG Models
                namespace</li>
            <li>Gene identifiers that match locus tags from the genome annotation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you have all of these, please open a new issue here where the BiGG
            team can provide communication and feedback:

            <a href="https://github.com/SBRG/bigg_models/issues/new">https://github.com/SBRG/bigg_models/issues/new</a></p>

        <p>Please note that loading models into BiGG is time-consuming, so we
            cannot make any guarantee regarding the time it will take to load a model.</p>
